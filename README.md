# Daxy_LOOP_Code:

## Overview
This project implements the Double Precision AÂ·X Plus Y (DAXPY) operation,
a common routine in linear algebra, using both serial and parallel processing methods.
The parallel processing is achieved through the OpenMP API.

## Features
- Implements the DAXPY operation in a serial manner.
- Parallel implementation using OpenMP for improved performance on multi-core processors.
- Performance comparison between serial and parallel executions.
